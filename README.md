# Biodiversity hotspots near fast-growing urban areas

## Overview
A repository to contain Group 6's project materials.

## Proposal
[Here is a link to our Google Slides project proposal.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SedyNGOyZhrfzUIoQiMh7W-5seJRaJYRI8bk1hIX4qc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Project Components
Our main datasets will include US Census Bureau population data from 2010 and 2020. 
We will also utilize the recent data and maps on EPA Level IV ecoregions.

## Resources
Note: Though not all of theses maps may be used in our data collection, their attribute tables, visualizations, and other methodology are still considered as we formulate our project.
